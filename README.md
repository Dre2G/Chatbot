Hi thanks for checking out my chat bot.

You should download a few programs to get this bot started.


First will be an updated Python editor (sublime text).

Second will be Git Bash.

It is safer to use the bot in a virtual environment as it is feared the code could manipulate other programs. To do this you must first navigate to the folder of your chatbot in the Git bash terminal.
Now that you are in the folder: 1. **Create** your virtual environment named `virt`:
```
python -m venv virt
```

2. **Activate** the newly created virtual environment by typing:
- On **Windows (Git Bash or Command Prompt):**
```
source virt/Scripts/activate
```
- On **Linux or macOS:**
```
source virt/bin/activate
```
Once done, you'll see `(virt)` before your command prompt, confirming you're successfully within your virtual environment.To open the bot, simply type "python chat.py".

If you choose to have the bot run wild within your envronment you can simply get into the folder where the code file is kept and double click the python file. If you use the bot often you can always create a shortcut
on your desktop. Don't forget you must have a chatgpt api an order to use the bot.

                     
*"This chatbot represents my initial venture into chatbot development, and as such, its underlying code is now outdated."*
