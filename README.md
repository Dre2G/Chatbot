Hi thanks for checking out my chat bot.

You should download a few programs to get this bot started.


First will be an updated Python editor (sublime text).

Second will be Git Bash.

It is safer to use the bot in a virtual environment as it is feared the code could manipulate other programs. To do this you must first navigate to the folder of your chatbot in the Git bash terminal.
Now that you are in the folder you will activate the virtual environment by typing "source virt/scripts/activate". You should see a "virt" above your name. To open the bot, simply type "python chat.py".

If you choose to have the bot run wild within your envronment you can simply get into the folder where the code file is kept and double click the python file. If you use the bot often you can always create a shortcut
on your desktop. Don't for get you must have a chatgpt api an order to use the bot.
